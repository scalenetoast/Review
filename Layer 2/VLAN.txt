for ROAS, you must configure the encapsulation + vlan allowed on the subinterface before you can give the subinterface an IP Address.
'encapsulation dot1q {num} [native]'

remember to enable the ROUTER interface, it is disabled by default even when connected

SVIs are the default gateways for the VLANs. Then L3 switch has a point to point with the router (other L3 switches?)

default keyword comes first when resetting interface configs to defaults

REMEMBER 'ip routing' cmd on L3 SWITCH!!!!!

ALSO 'no switchport' to go from switchport to L3 port. this is for physical interfaces (NOT FOR SVI)

when configuring route, dont forget NEXT HOP IP!!

if a L2 switch recaives a frame from VLANX, it will only forward/flood the frame out interfaces (access or trunk) within VLANX. 
Need a router/L3 Switch for inter-vlan routing

trunk links allow all vlans by default, so make sure to allow only needed vlans

the encapsulation dot1q {vlan-num}  //the vlan num MUST match, it is what the router looks at for TAGGING. subinterface id can be diff
if you change the encapsulation on the interface, it will remove the IP address configured on it, so you have to do it again

SVI numbers must match with the VLAN they are supposed to be matched to!!
SVI are disabled by default

BIG POINTS:

1.) Enable router interfaces
2.) 'encapsulation dot1q {vlan-id}' on router subinterfaces before assigning IP Address
3.) 'ip routing' on L3 switch to enable routing!!!
3.5.) 'no switchport' to enable routing for L3 switch interface
