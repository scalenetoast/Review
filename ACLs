ACL Notes:

Standard Access Control Lists:
(Apply closest to destination)

watch out for implicit deny
if an acl is updated or added to, you dont need to reapply it to the interface

Extened Access Control Lists:
(Apply closest to source)

watch out for implicit deny
if an acl is updated or added to, you dont need to reapply it to the interface

IRL ACL Tip:
 - Don't use Standard ACLs, just use Extended
 - Consider aggregation when applying the ACL.
