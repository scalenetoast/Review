DNS Notes:

DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

internet would not work without it
in packet tracer router can't act as dns servers
router will forward/route dns queries without any config because its basically a normal packet

Remember to release and renew DHCP on the client if changes have been made to the DHCP pool on the DHCP server!!!
you can set a DNS server and default gateway on the switch the same way you do one a router in IOS. 

Typing this "ping google.com" with DNS means this "ping [ip address]"
