DHCP Notes:

DYNAMIC HOST CONGURATION PROTOCOL

check if DHCP is enabled (service dhcp)
dhcp-config mode
'no shutdown' router interfaces!!!!
Understand where the DHCP clients are located and what info the will need (default gateway, etc)
If router is being used as DHCP server within the same subnet. Exclude the IP address of the router, so DHCP does not assign it.

Configure helper address cmd on interface with DHCP clients
Use IP address if the DHCP server in the helper address cmd

Router will add to ip dhcp binding even if the full DORA process has not been completed. If a device sends a discover and the DHCP server
sends the offer, it will show as being binded becasue that IP has been currently reserved for that device even though the full DORA has not gone
through.
