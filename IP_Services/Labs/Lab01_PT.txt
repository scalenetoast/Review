Objectives:

Packet Tracer Lab 1: Mini Branch Office Network (DHCP + NAT + CDP/LLDP + SSH)

Topology:

    2 Routers (HQ + Branch)

    2 Switches

    2 PCs

    1 Server

Tasks:

    DHCP server on HQ router serving both sites (via DHCP relay).

    NAT overload (PAT) for internet access at HQ router.

    Enable CDP and LLDP and validate device connections.

    Configure SSH access to both routers.

    Test name resolution if DNS is available (optional extra).

Key Concepts Reinforced:

    NAT and DHCP playing together

    Neighbor discovery (CDP/LLDP)

    Remote device management with SSH

    Layer 3 and Layer 2 discovery visibility


NOTES:

HQ: 10.0.0.0/8
Branch: 192.168.1.0/24

SSH

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- make sure routers have ROUTES to different subnets!!!!
- make sure the inside and outside NAT interfaces are properly CONFIGURED (ip nat inside should be done on the interface facing the LAN and same for outside)
- just because domain name is added to the DHCP pool, it does not mean the DHCP server will get the same domain name. You must manually Configure a 
domain name on the server. (clients will receive the domain name from dhcp pool)
- make sure the pool names are coorect when want to re-config the pool. make sure it does not create a new pool with a slightly similar name
- make sure host IPs in ACLs don't change or watch out for when they do (probably due to DHCP)
- telnet uses user accounts to login as well.

SSH setup steps:

1. set a hostname (non default)
2. set a domain name (completes the FQDN need for rsa key gen)
3. enable secret
4. create a user account (username {name} secret {passsword})
5. generate rsa keys
6. create an ACL that permits certain IPs to SSH/Telnet
6. enter vty line config mode
7. set the account info that the telnet/ssh client will have to enter to proceed (login local)
8. set timeout time
9. transport input [ssh | telnet | all | none]
10. link ACL to vty line
