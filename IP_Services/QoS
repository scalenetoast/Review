QoS


Voice Vlans:

router sub interfaces must be configured with a vlan (encapsulation dot1q {vlan-id}) before it can be assigned an IP address.

Switch tells IP Phone what VLAN it is in and Router tells IP Phone its phone number

****Voice VLAN data is tagged even though its connected to an access port****
Data traffic from the PC is untagged as usual.


4 traffic classes
3 levels of drop precedence
