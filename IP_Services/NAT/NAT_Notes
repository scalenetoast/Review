NAT Notes:

NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION 

Static NAT:

Dynamic NAT:

not like DHCP pool. there is no NAT pool config mode!!
You must add a specific range for address that can be used for NAT. With DHCP it just tkaes the network address and mask (only excludes specified address)
NAT ACLs are NOT applied to an interface! They are mapped to a NAT pool and that's how they filter which address get translated!!!

need to have netmask when config a NAT pool, DHCP pool does not need this
